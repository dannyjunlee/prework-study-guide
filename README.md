# Intro to Web Development via Columbia Coding Boot Camp

## Description

This project is a place to add notes for the prework module contents in the Columbia Coding Boot Camp course. I built this project because I wanted to not only test the skills I acquired from the course but also to help organize my notes in an acceessible manner. This project solves the problem of finding a suitable place to take and store notes.
